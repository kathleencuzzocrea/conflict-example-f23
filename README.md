Merge conflicts, DO fear them!!!! AAHHHHHHHHH!!!!

This is content that was defintely added through the GitHub interface. I am purposely causing an intentional merge conflict on purpose.

Thid sentefnce was addefd locally and spelled incorrectly.

This is a repo that is used, in cl ass, to demonstrate how to solve a merge conflict when it occurs with your teammates. Sometimes Github will automatically solve the issue, other times it cannot and requires human intervention.
